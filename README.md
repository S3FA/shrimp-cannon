(Yep it is totally based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkaIoH6Um60))

## Control box

The effects are controlled by a [wifire16](http://propaneandelectrons.com/projects/wifire16) running the code in the `shrimpcannon` folder.

The control box code depends on:
* Button: https://github.com/virgildisgr4ce/Button
* TLC5940: http://code.google.com/p/tlc5940arduino/

## Funnel

The funnels for flour and bread crumbs where made of laser cut acrylic and powered by compressed air. More details (including DXF files) in the `funnels` folder.
