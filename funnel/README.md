# Funnels

The files are for the funnels to hold the flour and breading. We cut ours out of 1/4" clear acrylic on [Site 3](http://site3.ca)'s laser cutter. We attached the pieces together using acrylic solvent after placing them in a simple jig made with two pieces of MDF.

After curing the funnel was slightly too small at the bottom to fit a 3/4" pipe. The bottom of the funnel was carefully cut using a chop saw. Once the pipe fit it was affixed the bottom with resin.
